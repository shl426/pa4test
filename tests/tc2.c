 /* Test Case 2: Yield/Spawn Ordering
 *
 * In this program you are to kill the zombies that are spawned. The only
 * way to correctly kill the zombies is by killing every third zombie you
 * see 32 times, or else all hell breaks loose! You must use your knowledge
 * of OS to yield to the zombie, kill it it, and save the world!
 *
 * You should test your kernel by seeing if it will work with the program
 * below, as well as other test cases you design.  You should test it
 * thoroughly, as it will be graded by seeing if it successfully runs with
 * other test programs (not available to you).
