/**
 * Test case 1: Spawning Threads, and their stacks
 * 
 * This test case will attempt to spawn 10 threads. The first 9 should
 * be successful, but the 10th one should fail.
 * 
 * Afterwards the program will go through each thread, checking if
 * each thread's stack is at least STACKSIZE apart.
 * 
 * Then the program will respawn all the threads again and check
 * if each thread's stack started at the same location as before.
